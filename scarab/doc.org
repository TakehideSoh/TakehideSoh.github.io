* Introduction
This web page details *Scarab* system which is a prototyping tool for
developing SAT-based systems. It provides a rich constraint modeling
language on Scala and enables a programmer to rapidly specify problems
and to experiment with different modelings.
** *Expressiveness:* 
   - Scarab DSL can concisely write constraint modelings with the help of rich functionalities of Scala.
   - The expressiveness of Scarab will be also shown by some prototyping examples for an optimization version of Square Packing.
** *Efficiency:* 
   - Scarab can be efficient in the sense that it uses an optimized version of the order encoding which an award-winning CSP solver [[http://bach.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/sugar/][Sugar]] adopted.
   - Scarab also can utilize current state-of-the-art SAT techniques.
** *Customizability:* 
   - Scarab allows a programmer to customize his/her own constraints and to customize the search strategies.
   - Scarab itself can be also customizable since it is *500* lines
     (800 lines in version 1.0.4) long without any comments.
   - In particular, our core part of order encoding module is only *25* lines long.
** *Portability:* 
   - The current version of Scarab adopts [[http://www.sat4j.org][Sat4j]] as the back-end SAT solver. 
   - The combination of Scarab and Sat4j makes it possible to develop portable SAT-based systems that run on any platform supporting Java.

** *User Program (in Scala and Scarab DSL):* 
   - The process starts with a user program, which will first define Scarab objects
   - Those definitions are typically done by the followng Scala program:
  #+BEGIN_SRC scala
    val csp = new CSP()
    val satSolver = new Sat4j()
    val encoder = new OrderEncoder(csp,satSolver)
    val solver = new Solver(csp,satSolver,encoder)
  #+END_SRC
   - Each line creates a new CSP object (*csp*), SAT solver object (*satSolver*), Encoder object (*encoder*), and Solver object (*solver*), which are shown in the above figure.
   - Initially, of course, the CSP object has nothing and the next task is to add contents of it
   - To do that, Scarab DSL provides the following methods for constructing a CSP:
     - *int*, *bool* for adding integer variables and Boolean variables to the CSP object.
     - *add* for adding constraints to the CSP object.
     - The syntax of constraints in Scarab is given below in this page.
** *CSP Object:* 
   - A CSP object consists of the followings, which will be defined in the user program:
     1) integer variables
     2) Boolean variables
     3) domain function of integer variables
     4) constraints
   - All objects above are defined as var objects. Totally, CSP is a mutable object.
** *Encoder (Decoder):* 
   - It encodes each element of a given CSP according to SAT encoding method (currently, order encoding)
   - Simultaneously, encoded SAT clauses are passed to Sat4j solver on memory
   - It also decodes assignments of SAT variables to assiginments of CSP variables by using a mapping object.
** *Sat4j:* 
   - Scarab provides an interface to Sat4j and can directly call it.
   - Thus, we can use Sat4j without generating CNF files, invoking outer processes, and parsing output logs.
   - After solving problems, we can obtain assignments of SAT variables

* Syntax of Scarab DSL (for Constraints)
** Let *V*, *T*, *C* and *B* be the Scarab objects of *Var*, *Term*, *Constraint*, and *Bool*.
** Let Int, String, and Any be Scala objects.
** The syntax of Scarab DSL is defined as follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE lisp
 T  ::= V | -T | T + Int | T + T | T - Int | T - T | T * Int | Sum(V, ...) | Sum(Seq(V, ...))  
 V  ::= Var(String, String, ...) | V(Any, ...)
 C  ::= B | T op T | !C | C && C | C || C | alldiff(Seq(T, ...)) |  
       And(C, ...) | And(Seq(C, ...)) | Or(C, ...) | Or(Seq(C, ...))
 op ::= <= | < | => | > | === | !==
 B  ::= Bool(String, String, ...) | B(Any, ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Examples of Constraint
*** A constraint $x_{1} + 3 \le 4$ is written as follows
  #+BEGIN_SRC scala
'x(1) + 3 <= 4
  #+END_SRC
