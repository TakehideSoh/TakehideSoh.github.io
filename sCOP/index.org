* Overview of sCOP
  - sCOP is a Sat-based COnstraint Programming system written in Scala
    2.12.
  - sCOP aims to be a re-implementation of [[http://bach.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/sugar/][Sugar]] (Tamura et al.) 
    written in Java. Many things are imported from [[http://bach.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/sugar/][Sugar]] (software 
    design, normalization, and encoding). Currently, main differences
    are as follows: 
    - [[http://xcsp.org][XCSP3]] instances is accepted as input in sCOP. 
    - Encoding of extensional constraints is different between the two systems.
    - Some of encoding heuristics is different between the two systems.
    - Log encoding (from CSP into SAT) is implemented by using the BDD
      encoding ([[https://satassociation.org/jsat/index.php/jsat/article/view/18][Een and Sorensson]]). 
  - It works as follows:
    1. encode a XCSP3 file into a DIMACS CNF file.
    2. launch a SAT solver to solve the encoded CNF file.
    3. the output of the SAT solver is decoded to the solution of the
       XCSP3 instance.

* Download
  - [[file:scop-for-xcsp18-180731.tar.gz][the version submitted to XCSP18]]

* Components of sCOP
  - scop.jar
    - It is a fat jar containing all resources except SAT solvers
      - XCSP3-Java-Tools (https://github.com/xcsp3team/XCSP3-Java-Tools)
      - scop
      - scala standard libraries (version 2.12)

  - scop.sh
    - It is a wrapper for XCSP18. 

  - MapleCOMSPS
    - It is an award-winning SAT solver downloaded from the following
      URL.
    - Note that there are several versions of MapleCOMSPS in the
      official web page. The one we used is only available in the
      exactly the same URL as follows.
    - Note again, we used "simp" not "core".
    - https://sites.google.com/a/gsd.uwaterloo.ca/maplesat/MapleCOMSPS.zip

  - glucose-syrup
    - It is an award-winning SAT solver downloaded from the following
      URL.
    - Note that we used the version submitted to the SAT competition 2017.
    - https://baldur.iti.kit.edu/sat-competition-2017/solvers/parallel/syrup.zip

* Requirements for sCOP
  - Java 8
  - (Note) Scala 2.12 is not necessary since scop.jar is a fat jar
    containing scala standard libraries.

* Notations in the following
| DIR       | It stands for the directory where you place scop-for-xcsp18          |
| TMPDIR    | It is the directory where the solver is allowed to                   |
|           | create temporary files                                               |
| BENCHNAME | It stands for the name of the instance file (with its extension)     |
| NBCORE    | It stands for the number of processing units allocated to the solver |

* How to install
  - We need to compile 2 SAT solvers respectively for sequential
    solving and parallel solving. 

** (Sequential CSP) MapleCOMSPS
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd DIR/MapleCOMSPS
export MROOT=`pwd`
cd simp
make clean
make r
#+END_SRC

** (Parallel CSP) glucose-syrup
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd DIR/syrup
make clean
make
#+END_SRC

** lzma (os command)
   - we assume an os command 'lzma' is available for decomposing *.xml.lzma instances.
   - If there is not 'lzma' then simply give *.xml to scop.

* How to run
  - (NOTE) we here assume 11GB/22GB can be allocated to JVM. This is
    XCSP18 competition setting but larger heap size is better in
    principal.
  - assume that the following command is executed in the 'scop-for-xcsp18' directory.
  - *(Sequential CSP) with -both option*
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    DIR/scop.sh 11g DIR/scop.jar -both DIR/MapleCOMSPS/simp/minisat_release default TMPDIR BENCHNAME
    #+END_SRC
  - *(Sequential CSP) with -order option*
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh 
    DIR/scop.sh 11g DIR/scop.jar -order DIR/MapleCOMSPS/simp/minisat_release default TMPDIR BENCHNAME
    #+END_SRC
  - *(Parallel CSP) with -both option*
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    DIR/scop.sh 22g DIR/scop.jar -both DIR/syrup/bin/glucose-syrup -model:-nthreads=NBCORE:-maxmemory=20000 TMPDIR BENCHNAME
    #+END_SRC
  - *(Parallel CSP) with -order option*
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    DIR/scop.sh 22g DIR/scop.jar -order DIR/syrup/bin/glucose-syrup -model:-nthreads=NBCORE:-maxmemory=20000 TMPDIR BENCHNAME
    #+END_SRC

* Example (please refer http://xcsp.org/series for example XCSP3 instances)
  - (NOTE) we here assume 11GB/24GB can be allocated to JVM. This is
    XCSP18 competition setting but if possible larger size is
    preferred. 
  - assume that the following command is executed in the 'scop-for-xcsp18' directory.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./scop.sh 16g scop.jar -both MapleCOMSPS/simp/minisat_release default /tmp examples/AllInterval-007.xml
#+END_SRC
