** [2015.01.09] [[./scarab-v1-5-6.jar][JAR of Scarab]] -- Version 1.5.6 is released. 
# *** [2015.01.05] [[./scarab-v1-5-4.jar][JAR of Scarab]] -- Version 1.5.4 is released. 
    - To run this version, Scala 2.11.* or higher is required. 
    - Support non-contiguous domain.
    - Performance improvement.
      - Order Encoding Module is tuned.

** [2014.07.05] [[./scarab-v1-1-2.zip][Scarab -- Version 1.1.2]] is released
*** Native BC and Natice PB are implemented on Scarab.
*** some bug fix. 

** [2014.07.01] [[./scarab-v1-1-1.zip][Scarab -- Version 1.1.1]] is released
*** it is adopted to Scala 2.11.*
** [2014.05.27] [[./scarab-v1-1-0.zip][Scarab -- Version 1.1.0]] is released
*** bug fix (in the case constraint includes some obvious domain inconsitency).
** [2014.01.31] [[./scarab-v1-0-8.zip][Scarab -- Version 1.0.8]] is released
*** some bug fix.
** [2013.12.25] [[./scarab-v1-0-6.zip][Scarab -- Version 1.0.6]] is released
*** It supports boolInt type.
*** It supports external SAT solvers like minisat, glucose, and lingeling.

** [2013.11.25] [[./scarab-v1-0-4.zip][Scarab -- Version 1.0.4]] is released
*** Native Encoder is updated.
*** Sat4j included in Scarab JAR is updated.
*** This version is written in about 800 lines of Scala without comments.

** [2013.10.04] [[./scarab-v1-0-3.zip][Scarab -- Version 1.0.3]] is released
*** Internally, Constraints are now represented by using LeZero, GeZero, EqZero, NeZero, Bool, and Not @@html:<br>@@(Until 1.0.2, all of constraints are represented by using only LeZero, Bool, Not).
*** Addition to OrderEncoder, NativeEncoder is now available, which directly passes Boolean cardinality constraints to Sat4j without SAT encoding.
*** This version introduces many Sat4j configurations: "MiniLearningHeap", "MiniLearningHeapEZSimp", "Glucose21", "BestWL", "BestHT", "SAT", "UNSAT", "greedy" etc
*** You can use it by defining SAT solvers like: new Sat4j("MiniLearningHeap")
** [2013.09.14] [[./scarab-v1-0-2.zip][Scarab -- Version 1.0.2]] is released 
*** [[http://www.sat4j.org][Sat4j]] verion 2.3.5 is now included
*** some bug fix is done
*** "findNext" of solver is introduced for enumerating solutions (enumeration feature of "find" is dismounted).
** [2013.07.08-12] Scarab is presented at [[http://www.satcompetition.org/PoS13/][PoS-13]] and [[http://sat2013.cs.helsinki.fi][SAT]] (paper for the PoS workshop is available [[./pos2013scarab.pdf][here]]).
** [2013.05.27] We have move examples (see [[./examples.html][Examples]]) 
** [2013.04.20] [[./scarab-v1-0-1.zip][Scarab -- Version 1.0.1]] is released 
*** [[http://www.sat4j.org][Sat4j]] verion 2.3.3 is now included
*** ModelIterator of Sat4j is [[./examples.html][available]] to use
** [2013.04.12] Web page is re-organized 
** [2013.04.12] Class diagrams are added to [[./doc.html][Documents]] 
** [2013.03.25] Magic Square is added to [[./examples.html][Examples]] 


* Old versions
Since Scala is not binary comaptible in major versions, the following
older version may need re-compile accorinding to your environment.
